#Safer-Systems-Programming is a two- part project to evaluate Rust as an uncommonly used programming language. In part (a), I evaluate Rust using explicitly
//required criteria and inject a novel lens of cybersecurity as independent criteria. For part (b), I develop and demonstrated a use-case to highlight findings.
//The project stems from Master level coursework at George Washington University's SEAS.
